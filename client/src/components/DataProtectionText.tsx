        <h4>General information</h4>
            <p>The following study is part of a thesis at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).</p>

            <h4>Voluntary participation and freely given consent</h4>
            <p>Participation in the study is voluntary. The consent to participate in this study can be revoked at any time and without giving reasons until the end of the data collection process by either ending the survey (a corresponding button is available on the website) or closing the browser window. All incomplete data records will be deleted by us. After the end of data collection, the statutory rights of revocation, information, correction, blocking and deletion can no longer be exercised because the data can no longer be attributed to the data subject.</p>

            <h4>What data do we collect from you?</h4>
            <p>After consent to the collection of data, the following data are collected and processed anonymously: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Entries in the online survey</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            For  technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser  transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files), is  collected:</p>
            <p>
            </p><ul>
                <li> type and version of the browser you use</li>
                <li>  operating system</li>
                <li>  websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL)</li>
                    <li>  date and time of your visit</li>
                    <li>  your Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
            This anonymous data is not merged with the survey data. On this website we use so-called cookies. Cookies are small files that are stored by your web browser. The cookies used on our website do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain any malicious software. They enable a user-friendly and effective use of this website. We use permanent cookies with a maximum validity period of 365 days. We use these cookies exclusively to exclude multiple participation. 
            </p>

            <h4>Anonymization of data</h4>
            <p>With the transfer of the collected data to our server, an anonymization takes place, which makes it practically impossible to assign the collected data to a person, as long as no personal data is entered in free text fields. 
            </p>

            <h4>What do we use your data for?</h4>
            <p>The results and data are used exclusively for scientific research purposes and will be published anonymously as part of the final thesis and as a scientific publication of this study. They can also be processed anonymously for other scientific research purposes. The student Atiq Ur Rehman Waqar receives access to the anonymous data record exclusively for the evaluation within the scope of his thesis. 
            </p>
